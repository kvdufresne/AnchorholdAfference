# Anchorhold Afference
As an anchoress, Julian of Norwich confined herself to a form of reality and existence that many cannot fully understand due to its harsh and regimented size, complete isolation, and ultimate sensory deprivation.  To make her writings and realities as an anchoress more accessible to students, I created a virtual reality system modeled after Julian of Norwich’s anchorhold through utilizing Oculus and Unity gaming applications. These technologies inherently carry vast amounts of art, design, geometry, and physics, proving themselves to be reflective of an interdisciplinary experience and study - yet are not typically utilized in the English Literature classroom. Fascinatingly numerous parallels arose between VR creation, implementation, and utilization as the experience of the anchorhold, including the roles of barriers, isolation, sensory deprivation, and wear on the body. Thus, VR technology can allow us to perhaps discover and evaluate how the restriction of place and space are evident and relevant factors presented in her written works as well as help users to embody her own positionality.  Lastly, and most significantly, past scholarship has focused on how VR prepares students “for the worlds they will navigate in the future” (Misak 42), but it can easily be argued that VR implementation allows for students to explore and better understand worlds and positionalities that no longer exist or that we have limited access to - such as Julian of Norwich’s anchorhold.
